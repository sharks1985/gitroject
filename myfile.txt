This is my first line in my git tracked file.

Agenda today:
1. collaborating with GitHub (cloud based source code hosting)


https://github.com/sharks1985/gitroject.git

…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# gitroject" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/sharks1985/gitroject.git
git push -u origin master
                
…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/sharks1985/gitroject.git
git push -u origin master
…or import code from another repository
You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
